My name is Sacha Best - I am a software engineer and entrepreneur with experience in finance, computer graphics, virtual reality, enterprise software, and more.

I currently work on data strategy at [Citadel](https://www.citadel.com/)'s Global Fixed Income fund, with previous positions at [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/careers/technology/engineering/), SpaceX, Disney Animation, Activision, and Sony. You can view a more formal listing of work experience as well as a formal resume on my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/sachabest) profile. For all code-related things, check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/sachabest).

I graduated in 2017 from the University of Pennsylvania with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the School of Engineering. While at Penn, I taught a [course](https://pennvr.com) in virtual reality with [Trung Le](http://www.trungtuanle.com/), created [Project Em](https://devpost.com/software/pennapps-2016f), and served as a teaching assistant for many different CS classes, including [software engineering](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis350/) and [market and social systems on the internet](http://www.nets.upenn.edu/content/nets-150). I am also a member of [the Bell Society](http://www.bellsociety.com).

When I'm not working, you'll most likely find me skiing, surfing, or making video games.

I [recently](https://github.com/sachabest/sachabest.github.io/commits) remade this website, and plan to [blog](/blog) at least once a month on something fun. Please follow along :)
